                <li>Dog food and accessories.</li><br>
                <li>Dog's day care center.</li><br>

                <li>Dog's breeding center.</li><br>

            <ol>
                <li>In states like California and New York 1/3rd of total households have dogs. Meaning every 1 out of 3 houses have a dog. Thus states with higher population of dog owners like California and New York are good for selling large amount of products.</li><br>
                <li>Whereas in Mississippi and Idaho 1/2 of the total households have dogs. Meaning every second house has a dog, but being less populated, they will not serve well for large businesses.</li><br>
                <li>Many dogs within state means many dog parks.</li><br>
                <li>Many dogs within state means many dog breeding centers to buy a dog from.</li>

                <li>In states like California, New York and Texas 1/4th of total households have cats. Meaning every 1 out of 4 houses have a cat. However, since these states have a higher population so they can become the hotspots for my business.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Whereas in Washington and Florida 1/3rd of the total households have cats. Meaning every 1 out of 3 houses has a cat. However, since they are less populated, they might not serve well to start a big business.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Thus according to the size of my business I might see which state might serve me well. I would choose a state with larger number of cat owners and also a larger population as well.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Many cats within state means many cat breeding centers to buy cats from.</li>
